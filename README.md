## About UniReview

UniReview is a website where university aspirants can get to read reviews on their school of interest.
These reviews are written by Students and Alumnis, thereby making them useful to universities, to also know where and how to improve!
I had a tough time finding reviews for the University I wanted to attend, and that made me come up with the solution.

Here are some of the main features of UniReview highlighted below.

- Helps university aspirants make better decisions in choosing the right university form themselves.
- Provides a voice for university students and Alumnis, to share their experience, studying at a school.
- Give universities an insight to where they need to improve, and how to provide a better experience for their students.
