## About UniReview

UniReview is a website where university aspirants can get to read reviews on their school of interest.
These reviews are written by Students and Alumnis, thereby making them useful to universities, to also know where and how to improve! <br>
I personally had a tough time finding reviews for the University I wanted to attend, and that made me come up with this solution.

Here are some of the main features of UniReview highlighted below.

- Helps university aspirants make better decisions in choosing the right university.
- Provides a voice for university students and Alumnis, to share their experience, studying at a school.
- Give universities an insight into where and how they need to improve.

UniReview doesn't accept any user's data, thus making it completely safe for everyone to use.
